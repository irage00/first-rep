My first attempt at creating and managing a github repo

Hey everyone! I am Alex Fedd. This repo branch is called readme-edits as it is the same as the master branch but for one things: the readme file in this branch has this text. 

I will commit this change and descrive it so as to get a better understanding of how branching and GitHyb work.

Cya!
